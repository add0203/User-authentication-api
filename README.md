**User Authentication Node.js Program - README**

This repository contains a Node.js program for user authentication using various technologies and methodologies. This program provides secure authentication functionalities for your Node.js applications.

### Features:

1. **User Registration**: Users can register for an account by providing their email and password. Passwords are securely hashed before storage.

2. **User Login**: Registered users can log in using their email and password credentials.

3. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using industry-standard hashing algorithms before storage in the database to ensure confidentiality.

4. **Session Management**: Sessions are managed securely to maintain user authentication across multiple requests.

### Technologies Used:

Sure, here's a one-line description for each of the dependencies listed:

1. **bcryptjs**: Library for hashing passwords using bcrypt algorithm with asynchronous support.
2. **body-parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in Express.js.
3. **crypto**: Node.js built-in module providing cryptographic functionalities.
4. **email-validator**: Library for validating email addresses.
5. **express**: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
6. **express-async-handler**: Utility function for handling asynchronous errors in Express.js route handlers.
7. **jsonwebtoken**: Library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
8. **mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
9. **nodemailer**: Module for sending emails with Node.js.
10. **nodemon**: Utility that monitors for changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server.

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   JWT_SECRET = "group_project"
   EMAIL_PASS = <Email password>
   PORT = 3002
   DB_LINK = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Usage:

- Register a new user by navigating to `/register` and providing an email and password.
- Log in with registered credentials by navigating to `/login`.
- Secure routes can be created by using Passport.js middleware to authenticate users.
