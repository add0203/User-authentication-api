**User Authentication Node.js Program - README**

This repository contains a Node.js program for user authentication using various technologies and methodologies. This program provides secure authentication functionalities for your Node.js applications.

### Features:

1. **User Registration**: Users can register for an account by providing their email and password. Passwords are securely hashed before storage.

2. **User Login**: Registered users can log in using their email and password credentials.

3. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using industry-standard hashing algorithms before storage in the database to ensure confidentiality.

4. **Session Management**: Sessions are managed securely to maintain user authentication across multiple requests.

### Technologies Used:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for building web applications and APIs.
- **Passport.js**: An authentication middleware for Node.js, used for handling user authentication strategies.
- **bcrypt.js**: A library for hashing and salting passwords to enhance security.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user credentials securely.

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
   SESSION_SECRET=<your-session-secret>
   ```

4. Start the server:
